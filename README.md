This code was developed by us base on two papers: "Radial Based Analysis of GRNN in Non-Textured Image Inpainting by Karthik R et al(https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04215)" and "Application of GRNN neural network in non-texture image inpainting
and restoration by Vahid K. Alilou et al (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167865515001476)" For any inquiries, please contact us via following email addresses (22520024@gm.uit.edu.vn and 22520625@gm.uit.edu.vn) .
